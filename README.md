# Algorithms and Data Structures course tasks

### Description
Here are presented most competitive problems I've completed within Algorithms and Data Structures course of Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Informatics, Belarusian State University.  

### Contents
Repository contains seven problems that covers main topics of Algorithms and Data Structures study. Here are problem names and topics covered:<br>
1. [Almost strictly increasing sequence](../master/almost_strictly_increasing_sequence) — Dynamic programming, recurrence equations
2. [BST semipath](../master/bst_semipath) — BST
3. [Park](../master/park) — Dynamic programming, recurrence equations, data structures
4. [Segment tree](../master/segment_tree) — Data structures
5. [String roll](../master/string_roll) — Dynamic programming, recurrence equations
6. [Words](../master/words) — Graphs, Eulerian path
7. [Segments](../master/segments) — Graphs, Hungarian algorithm

### How to use
Solutions are presented as C++ (.cpp) and C# (.cs) source code files. Solutions use file input/output. 

### Todo
* Solutions testing
* Detailed algorithm description and further reading for each problem
